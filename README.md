WHY SQL?

SQL has been used by Data Analysts to interact and manage the Relational Databases (RDB) systems, since its inception by IBM during the early 70s.
Some of the reasons why SQL is used as a tool for Data Analytics are its ability to retrieve data from multiple RDBs and its efficiency in Data Retrieval using simple, easy-to-understand 'queries'.
